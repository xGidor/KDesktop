## Important Notes
KDesktop uses FFmpeg to download and process videos via the downloader. FFmpeg is required for converting and extracting audio from video files. If FFmpeg is not installed on the system, KDesktop will attempt to download and configure it automatically.

KDesktop monitors the user's clipboard if the Clipboard Manager is **enabled**. This feature is purely for functionality and does not engage in any unauthorized or shady practices.
